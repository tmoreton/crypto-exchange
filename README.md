# Crypto Exchange

This project can be found at (https://crypto-exchange-stake.netlify.app).

The goal of the application was to connect to the Coingecko API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to pull in the top 10 Crypto currency exchanges and display some high level information about them like year created, origin country & trust score. If you want to see more information on a specific echange you can click in further to get a few more basic stats.

## Next Steps
- Add more information to the details page ie. supported currencies and tickers
- Implement typescript sitewide
- Add more detailed cypress tests
